# Future_Plans

 - Refactor `Player` class to move movement responsibilities into new class
 - Add ability for player to Push / Pull of of objects of type `Metal`
 - Re-work movement to add relative positions (when player reaches a certain extreme position, instead of him moving farther, scene should move around him)
 - Re-work state changes to dictate minimum frame counts for each
 - Add animations 
 - Add UI (Menus, level select, etc.)
 - Bug fixes
